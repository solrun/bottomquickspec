Examples of properties we would like to generate:
  Parametricity properties

What happens if we define approximation function?

Partial functions

Infinite structures - Finiteness predicate

Fast & loose reasoning example:
reverse . map (\x -> x - y) = revMap
is the left inverse of
mapRev = map (\x -> y + x) . reverse
this is true in a total setting, turns out to also be true in a partial setting for total finite lists xs and finite naturals n
(revMap . mapRev) xs [y -> n] = xs 
-- can we find more general conditions?

Properties that hold in a total language but not in the presence of bottoms, can we find the right conditions?
reverse . reverse = id
(\x -> x - y) . (\x -> x + y) = id
id . f = f
isTotal f => isBot f @ x = isBot x
